# Othello_Game
The goal of this project is to create a computerized version of the classic board game Othello (also known as Reversi) using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Othello is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 grid, where players take turns placing their colored discs (black and white) on the board with the objective of flipping their opponent's discs to their own color.

The project will involve designing and implementing methods to represent the game board, players, and the game itself. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their corresponding classes:

Board: This method will represent the game board and handle operations related to the board, such as initializing the starting positions, updating the board state, and checking for valid moves and game over conditions.

Player: This method will represent a player in the game. It will store information about the player's color (black or white) and handle moves made by the player. The player class will also interact with the board class to make valid moves and update the board state accordingly.

Game: This method will serve as the central control unit for the game. It will manage the game loop, alternating between players, and handling user input or AI moves. The game class will communicate with the board and player classes to get the current game state and update it as the game progresses. It will also handle the display of the game board and provide feedback to the players.

Additionally, you can enhance the game by incorporating the following features:

Score Tracking: Implement a scoring system to keep track of the players' scores throughout multiple game sessions.

By using OOP concepts, you can design a modular and extensible code structure that separates concerns and promotes code reuse. The classes will encapsulate the game logic and allow for easy maintenance, scalability, and future enhancements.
